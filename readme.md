# Implement an Event Listener

We've provided you with three files: `index.html` `style.css` and `script.js`.

Inside of `index.html`, you'll find two buttons, one that should turn the background to red and a second that should turn the background to blue. Write the necessary JavaScript to implement an event for each button.

You have been provided with two functions -- `changeBackgroundColorToBlue` and `changeBackgroundColorToWhite` -- that can be used as callbacks. You do not need to change the content of these functions.

When you're done, [it should display this functionality](https://git.generalassemb.ly/pages/ga-wdi-exercises/event-listener-practice/).

# Bonus:

If you finish early, see if you can implement it so that the background color changes when the user hovers over one of the buttons.
